## Completed for v0.2
- As a user I would like to see numbers on the tiles of the grid so that I can easily identify them
- As a user I would like to enable or disable tile numbers on the selection grid so that I can reduce visual clutter when needed.
- As a user I would like to toggle the tile number overlay from the web dashboard so that I can control the UI without touching the overlay window.
- As a user I would like the tile number visibility change to apply immediately so that I can see the effect without restarting the application.
