- Add unit tests for `StatusStore` history trimming and tile-mask behavior.
- Add unit tests for state resolution transitions and grace-vote behavior.
- Add structured timing diagnostics for capture, analysis, and publish cadence.

## Medium priority

- Add profile presets and validation helpers for common deployment scenarios.
- Add dashboard controls for more runtime tuning fields.
- Add optional persistence for recent UI region/grid preferences.

## Low priority

- Evaluate additional capture backends behind the existing abstraction.
